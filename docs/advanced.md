# Advanced

This page covers the specialized features layered on top of the core training stack: our custom model implementations (with EP for MoE families and CP for long-context training), multimodal training, LoRA training, and disaggregated prefill/decode inference. For developer-side workflows (adding new model architectures, debugging modeling code at small scale), see [Development](development.md).

## Custom Modeling

`prime-rl` ships custom optimized model implementations for several MoE families. With `model.impl = "auto"` (default) the trainer picks the custom path when the HF config type is registered, falling back to plain HF otherwise. To force one:

```toml
[trainer.model]
impl = "custom"        # or "hf" to force the HF path
```

| Family | HF config types | EP | CP |
|---|---|---|---|
| GLM-5 / GLM-5.2 (`glm_moe_dsa`) | `zai-org/GLM-5`, `zai-org/GLM-5-FP8`, `zai-org/GLM-5.2`, `zai-org/GLM-5.2-FP8` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Qwen3 MoE | `Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| Qwen3.5 MoE | `Qwen/Qwen3.5-35B-A3B`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| Qwen3 / Qwen3.5 VLMs | see [Multimodal training](#multimodal-training) | MoE only | ❌ |
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next | `Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next`, see [Qwen3.8-Flash-Next](#qwen38-flash-next) | ✅ | ✅ |
| Laguna | `poolside/Laguna-XS.2` | ✅ | ✅ |
| MiniMax M2 | `MiniMax/MiniMax-M2` | ✅ | ✅ |
| Nemotron H | `nvidia/Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B`, … | ✅ | ❌ |
| Trinity (AFMoE) | `arcee-ai/Trinity-Mini`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| GLM-4 / GLM-4.5 / INTELLECT-3 | `THUDM/GLM-4-9B-0414`, `zai-org/GLM-4.5`, `PrimeIntellect/INTELLECT-3`, … | ✅ | ✅ |
| GPT-OSS (HF MoE) | `openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b` | ❌ | ✅ |

The custom path enables you to set EP, CP, selective activation checkpointing, low-precision training (`[trainer.model.quantization]`), and faster MoE kernels (`moe_use_grouped_mm = true`, default). Forcing `impl = "hf"` is mostly useful when debugging — it's slower and disables most MoE-specific knobs.

### Low-precision training

Set `[trainer.model.quantization]` to train dense linears and MoE expert GEMMs in low precision. Two backends are available via the `type` discriminator:

- `type = "fp8"` — DeepGEMM FP8 blockwise (requires SM90+ / Hopper). Options: `enable_grouped_gemm` (FP8 MoE expert GEMM). Both default on.
- `type = "mxfp8"` — torchao MXFP8 microscaling (requires SM100+ / Blackwell). Options: `enable_grouped_gemm`, `enable_a2a` (MXFP8 expert-parallel all-to-all), and `recipe` (`mxfp8_rceil` default or `mxfp8_rceil_wgrad_with_hp`).

```toml
[trainer.model.quantization]
type = "mxfp8"
recipe = "mxfp8_rceil"
enable_a2a = true
```

GLM-5.2 adds IndexShare: the DSA sparse-attention indexer runs only on a subset of layers and the remaining layers reuse the cached top-k indices. The trainer reads this schedule from the model's `indexer_types` config field and enables the index cache automatically, so no extra config is needed. To override the schedule manually, set `[trainer.model.index_cache]` (`topk_freq` or `topk_pattern`).

### Qwen3.8-Flash-Next

`Qwen/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next` (`qwen4_exp`) is a ~180B composite VLM — `model_type = "qwen4_exp"` over a `qwen4_exp_text` text config — reusing the Qwen3.5-MoE SigLIP-style vision tower from transformers. Its 48 decoder layers are hybrid: every fourth layer is softmax attention (12 of 48), the rest are Gated DeltaNet linear attention. Every layer routes 10 of 512 experts and adds a gated shared expert. Hyper-connections widen the residual stream into `hc_count = 4` streams read through a low-rank mixer; the per-layer input and post-attention norms and the terminal `hyper_connection_mixer` are all part of that mechanism.

The 12 softmax layers run Qwen Sparse Attention (QSA): a multi-query indexer keeps the top-k compressed key blocks per query. prime-rl runs it through `torch.nn.attention.flex_attention` with exact QSA semantics, but on a 128-token block mask rather than QSA's native 4-token granularity. The indexer streams over query and compressed-key chunks while retaining only the current top-k, so its score workspace does not grow with the full query-by-key product. Sparse layers fall back to dense flash-attention varlen only when context parallelism is off and the batch's longest document is at most `dense_equivalent_seqlen`, the length below which every query keeps every visible block anyway. Equal indexer scores resolve to the earlier block within a document, making selection invariant to neighbouring packed documents. The indexer selects with a non-differentiable top-k and receives no gradient. The multi-token-prediction head in the checkpoint (`mtp.*`) is not implemented and is dropped on conversion.

One decoder layer carries hashed bigram/trigram embeddings (PLE), held as 128 checkpoint shards totalling 51.2B frozen parameters. During PrimeRL setup the table is removed from module state and divided across the `dp_shard_cp` mesh as read-only CPU-resident shards. Each forward routes hash IDs to the owning ranks and returns only the selected embeddings to the accelerator. The table is absent from FSDP, optimizers, trainer checkpoints and weight broadcasts. Resume and offline export rebind it from the resolved `trainer.model.name` in the run config, so the base snapshot must remain available and `model.name` must resolve to the same snapshot for the run's lifetime.

The bundled Qwen3.8 renderer produces image sidecars for training.

The shared Prime environment keeps its standard vLLM dependency. For Qwen3.8 day-one inference, build the dedicated image on top of the Qwen-capable vLLM runtime:

```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.qwen38-inference -t prime-rl-qwen38-inference .
docker run --gpus all --ipc=host --network=host \
  -v /path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next:/model:ro \
  -v /shared/prime-runs:/shared/prime-runs \
  prime-rl-qwen38-inference \
  --router None \
  --vllm.model /model \
  --vllm.tensor-parallel-size 8 \
  --vllm.enable-expert-parallel true \
  --vllm.enable-lora true \
  --vllm.lora-target-modules '["experts"]'
```

Run RL against that external server without an `[inference]` block:

```toml
output_dir = "/shared/prime-runs"

[deployment]
num_infer_gpus = 0

[orchestrator.model.client]
base_url = "http://inference-host:8000/v1"
admin_base_url = ["http://inference-host:8000/v1"]
```

Filesystem LoRA updates pass the adapter's absolute path to the inference server, so the trainer output directory must be mounted at the same path in the container.

There is no KV cache in the custom trainer path. PrimeRL LoRA uses a Qwen3.8-specific portable target recipe that excludes the frozen QSA indexer and includes the routed experts. The split Gated DeltaNet Q/K/V projections are omitted because released PEFT checkpoints represent them as one fused rank-r adapter.

### Expert Parallelism Backends

`model.ep_comm_backend` picks the all-to-all kernel used for EP dispatch/combine:

- **`torch`** (default): TorchTitan's all-to-all collective. Works everywhere, no extra install.
- **`deepep`**: Utilizes DeepEP's custom all-to-all collectives. This provides better performance if EP dimension spans multiple nodes. We provide pre-built binaries for H100/H200 with cuda runtime 12.9 installed, you can install them by running `uv sync --all-extras`.
DeepEP requires some careful tuning to achieve optimal performance, tuning parameters are `deepep_num_sms` and `deepep_token_chunk_size`.

With DeepEP, gradient clipping is currently not supported. (`optim.max_norm` is set to `None` automatically.)

## Multimodal Training

### Supported Families

The built-in VLM registry covers:

| Family | `model_type` | Vision attr | LM attr |
|---|---|---|---|
| Qwen3.5 | `qwen3_5` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |
| Qwen3.5-MoE | `qwen3_5_moe` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |
| Qwen3.8-Flash-Next | `qwen4_exp` | `model.visual` | `model.language_model` |

### Enabling VLM Mode

Add `[model.vlm]` and bfloat16 dtypes:

```toml
[model]
name = "Qwen/Qwen3.5-4B"
impl = "custom"
optimization_dtype = "bfloat16"
reduce_dtype = "bfloat16"

[model.vlm]
vision_encoder_attr = "model.visual"
language_model_attr = "model.language_model"
# freeze_vision_encoder = true  # default; set false to fine-tune the encoder
```

The weight-broadcast key prefix is derived as `{language_model_attr}.layers.` automatically.

VLM training requires a registered custom PrimeRL implementation.

### Limitations

- **Vision encoder frozen by default.** The default LoRA targets do not match Qwen3.5 vision modules. Set `freeze_vision_encoder = false` to fine-tune the encoder; this is incompatible with LoRA because LoRA freezes all non-adapter parameters.
- **bfloat16 mandatory.** The trainer config validator refuses any other `optimization_dtype` / `reduce_dtype` for VLMs — vLLM serves VLMs in bfloat16 and a mismatch breaks the importance ratio.
- **Higher KL mismatch with multi-image inputs.** Expect noisier `mismatch_kl` than text-only; this is from minor numerical differences between the trainer's and vLLM's image processing.
- **Images aren't logged to monitors.** Sample logging captures the prompt text but not the actual images.

## LoRA Training

LoRA is enabled by adding `[model.lora]`:

```toml
[model.lora]
rank = 16
alpha = 32
dropout = 0.0
```

`target_modules` defaults to a reasonable cross-family set (`q_proj`, `k_proj`, `v_proj`, `o_proj`, `gate_proj`, `up_proj`, `down_proj`, `experts`, plus a few latent-projection names for Nemotron). Unknown names are silently ignored, so the defaults work across architectures. Add architecture-specific names to extend coverage (e.g. `in_proj` / `out_proj` for Mamba).

LoRA is supported across SFT and RL. NCCL weight broadcast is **not** supported with LoRA — the default NCCL transport automatically falls back to filesystem when LoRA is enabled. Broadcast dirs of LoRA runs contain the raw adapter (`adapter_model.safetensors` + `adapter_config.json`).

## Disaggregated Prefill/Decode Inference

For large MoE serving, splitting prefill and decode onto separate vLLM groups can substantially improve throughput. Pick the prefill:decode ratio based on workload shape:

| Workload | P:D ratio | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Agentic (SWE, Lean) | 3:1 | Long growing contexts → prefill-heavy |
| Non-agentic (math, chat) | 1:2 | Short prompts, long generations → decode-heavy |

Example config: [`examples/advanced/glm-5.2/swe.toml`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/blob/main/examples/advanced/glm-5.2/swe.toml) — full RL run on `GLM-5` with P/D disaggregation behind a `vllm-router`, FP8 inference, and NCCL weight broadcast, paired with an inference config from [`examples/advanced/glm-5.2/infer/`](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-rl/tree/main/examples/advanced/glm-5.2/infer).

Monitor live queue depths to detect imbalance:

```bash
curl -s http://<prefill_node>:8100/metrics | grep num_requests_waiting
curl -s http://<decode_node>:8200/metrics | grep num_requests_waiting
```

If prefill queues and decode is idle, add prefill nodes (and vice versa).

**Required setup for disaggregated P/D (NIXL/UCX).** The pip-wheel NIXL's bundled UCX segfaults on the prefill→decode KV transfer (`signal 11: invalid permissions for mapped object` in `libucs.so`) — reproduced on vLLM 0.22 and 0.23, with/without mooncake, with/without llm-d. Building NIXL against UCX 1.19.x from source is therefore **required** (not optional) for disaggregated P/D.

```bash
salloc -N 1 --gres=gpu:1 bash -c 'bash scripts/install_nixl_from_source.sh'
uv pip install --reinstall --no-deps deps/nixl_cu12-*.whl
```

The script writes UCX 1.19 to `third_party/ucx/`; the bundled sbatch templates prepend it to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` so it overrides the system version. Re-run both commands after every `uv sync`, since the lock pins the wheel.
